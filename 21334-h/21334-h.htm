    <p>
      <i><b>The Author</b></i>. 'It is surprising,' says Mr. Percy Fitzgerald,
      'how much English Comedy owes to Irishmen.' Nearly fifty years ago
      Calcraft enumerated eighty-seven Irish dramatists in a by no means
      exhaustive list, including Congreve, Southerne, Steele, Kelly, Macklin,
      and Farquhar&mdash;the really Irish representative amongst the dramatists
      of the Restoration, the true prototype of Goldsmith and Sheridan.
      Thoroughly Irish by birth and education, Captain George Farquhar
      (1677-1707) had delighted the town with a succession of bright, rattling
      comedies&mdash;Love and a Bottle (1698), The Constant Couple (1699), Sir
      Harry Wildair (1701), The Inconstant (1702), The Twin Rivals (1702), The
      Recruiting Officer (1706). In an unlucky moment, when hard pressed by his
      debts, he sold out of the army on the strength of a promise by the Duke of
      Ormond to gain him some preferment, which never came. In his misery and
      poverty, with a wife and two helpless girls to support, Farquhar was not
      forsaken by his one true friend, Robert Wilks. Seeking out the dramatist
      in his wretched garret in St Martin's Lane, the actor advised him no
      longer to trust to great men's promises, but to look only to his pen for
      support, and urged him to write another play. 'Write!' said Farquhar,
      starting from his chair; 'is it possible that a man can write with
      common-sense who is heartless and has not a shilling in his pockets?'
      'Come, come, George,' said Wilks, 'banish melancholy, draw up your drama,
      and bring your sketch with you to-morrow, for I expect you to dine with
      me. But as <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/f006.png">[vi]</a></span>an
      empty purse may cramp your genius, I desire you to accept my mite; here is
      twenty guineas.' Farquhar set to work, and brought the plot of his play to
      Wilks the next day; the later approved the design, and urged him to
      proceed without delay. Mostly written in bed, the whole was begun,
      finished, and acted within six weeks. The author designed to dedicate it
      to Lord Cadogan, but his lordship, for reasons unknown, declined the
      honour; he gave the dramatist a handsome present, however. Thus was <i><b>The
      Beaux-Stratagem</b></i> written. Farquhar is said to have felt the
      approaches of death ere he finished the second act. On the night of the
      first performance Wilks came to tell him of his great success, but
      mentioned that Mrs. Oldfield wished that he could have thought of some
      more legitimate divorce in order to secure the honour of Mrs. Sullen.
      'Oh,' said Farquhar, 'I will, if she pleases, solve that immediately, by
      getting a real divorce; marrying her myself, and giving her my bond that
      she shall be a widow in less than a fortnight' Subsequent events
      practically fulfilled this prediction, for Farquhar died during the run of
      the play: on the day of his extra benefit, Tuesday, 29th April 1707, the
      plaudits of the audience resounding in his ears, the destitute,
      broken-hearted dramatist passed to that bourne where stratagems avail not
      any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Criticism of The Beaux-Stratagem</b></i>. Each play that Farquhar
      produced was an improvement on its predecessors, and all critics have been
      unanimous in pronouncing <i><b>The Beaux-Stratagem</b></i> his best, both
      in the study and on the stage, of which it retained possession much the
      longest. Except <i><b>The Recruiting Officer</b></i> and <i><b>The
      Inconstant</b></i>, revived at Covent Garden in 1825, and also by Daly in
      America in 1885, none of Farquhar's other <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/f007.png">[vii]</a></span>plays has been put on the stage
      for upwards of a century. Hallam says: 'Never has Congreve equalled <i><b>The
      Beaux-Stratagem</b></i> in vivacity, in originality of contrivance, or in
      clear and rapid development of intrigue'; and Hazlitt considers it
      'sprightly lively, bustling, and full of point and interest: the assumed
      disguise of Archer and Aimwell is a perpetual amusement to the mind.' The
      action&mdash;which commences, remarkably briskly, in the evening and ends
      about midnight the next day&mdash;never flags for an instant. The
      well-contrived plot is original and simple (all Farquhar's plots are
      excellent), giving rise to a rapid succession of amusing and sensational
      incidents; though by no means extravagant or improbable, save possibly the
      mutual separation of Squire Sullen and his wife in the last scene&mdash;the
      weak point of the whole. Farquhar was a master in stage-effect. Aimwell's
      stratagem of passing himself off as the wealthy nobleman, his brother (a
      device previously adopted by Vanbrugh in <i><b>The Relapse</b></i> and
      subsequently by Sheridan in his <i><b>Trip to Scarborough</b></i>), may
      perhaps be a covert allusion to the romantic story of the dramatist's own
      deception by the penniless lady who gave herself out to be possessed of a
      large fortune, and who thus induced him to marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The style adopted is highly dramatic, the dialogue being natural and
      flowing; trenchant and sprightly, but not too witty for a truthful reflex
      of actual conversation. The humour is genial and unforced; there is no
      smell of the lamp about it, no premeditated effort at dragging in jests,
      as in Congreve. As typical examples of Farquhar's <i><b>vis comica</b></i>
      I Would cite the description of Squire Sullen's home-coming, and his 'pot
      of ale' speech, Aimwell's speech respecting conduct at church, the scene
      between Cherry and Archer about the £2000, and the <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/f008.png">[viii]</a></span>final separation scene&mdash;which
      affords a curious view of the marriage tie and on which Leigh Hunt has
      founded an argument for divorce. This play contains several examples of
      Farquhar's curious habit of breaking out into a kind of broken blank verse
      occasionally for a few lines in the more serious passages. Partaking as it
      does of the elements of both comedy and force, it is the prototype of
      Goldsmith's <i><b>She Stoops to Conquer</b></i>, which it resembles in
      many respects. It will be remembered that Miss Hardcastle compares herself
      to Cherry (Act III.), and young Marlow and Hastings much resemble Archer
      and Aimwell. Goldsmith was a great admirer of the works of his
      fellow-countryman, especially <i><b>The Beaux-Stratagem</b></i>, and
      refers to them several times (Citizen of the World, letter 93; History of
      England, letter 16; Vicar of Wakefield, ch. 18), and in the Literary
      Magazine for 1758 he drew up a curious poetical scale in which he classes
      the Restoration dramatists thus:&mdash; Congreve&mdash;Genius 15, Judgment
      16, Learning 14, Versification 14; Vanbrugh&mdash;14, 15,14,10; Farquhar&mdash;15,
      15, 10, io. Unlike Goldsmith, unhappily, Farquhar's moral tone is not
      high; sensuality is confounded with love, ribaldry mistaken for wit The
      best that can be said of him that he contrasts favourably with his
      contemporary dramatists; Virtue is not <i><b>always</b></i> uninteresting
      in his pages. He is free from their heartlessness, malignity, and cruelty.
      The plot of <i><b>The Beaux-Stratagem</b></i> is comparatively
      inoffensive, and the moral of the whole is healthy. Although a wit rather
      than a thinker, Farquhar in this play shows himself capable of serious
      feelings. It is remarkable how much Farquhar repeats himself. Hardly an
      allusion or idea occurs in this play that is not to be found elsewhere in
      his works. In the Notes I have pointed out many of these coincidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/f009.png">[ix]</a></span><i><b>The
      Characters</b></i>. This play has added several distinct original
      personages to our stock of comedy characters, and it affords an excellent
      and lifelike picture of a peculiar and perishing phase of the manners of
      the time, especially those obtaining in the country house, and the village
      inn frequented by highwaymen. The sly, rascally landlord, Boniface (who
      has given his name to the class), is said to have been drawn from life,
      and his portrait, we are told, was still to be seen at Lichfield in 1775.
      The inimitable 'brother Scrub,' that 'indispensable appendage to a country
      gentleman's kitchen' (Hazlitt), with his ignorance and shrewd eye to the
      main chance, is likewise said to have been a well-known personage who
      survived till 1759, one Thomas Bond, servant to Sir Theophilus Biddulph;
      others say he died at Salisbury in 1744. Although Farquhar, like
      Goldsmith, undoubtedly drew his incidents and personages from his own
      daily associations, there is probably no more truth in these surmises than
      in the assertion (repeatedly made, though denied in his preface to <i><b>The
      Inconstant</b></i>) that Farquhar depicts himself in his young heroes, his
      rollicking 'men about town,' Roebuck, Mirabel, Wildair, Plume, Archer.
      Archer (copied by Hoadley in his character of Ranger in <i><b>The
      Suspicious Husband</b></i>) is a decided improvement on his predecessors,
      and is the best of all Farquhar's creations; he is assuredly the most
      brilliant footman that ever was, eminently sociable and, with all his
      easy, rattling volubility, never forgetful of his self-respect and never
      indifferent to the wishes or welfare of others. As Hunt has pointed out,
      the characters of Archer and Aimwell improve as the play progresses; they
      set out as mere intriguers, but prove in the end true gentlemen. They are
      sad rogues, no doubt, but they have no bitter cynicism, no meanness;
      Aimwell <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/f010.png">[x]</a></span>refuses
      to marry Dorinda under any deception. They thoroughly good fellows at
      bottom, manly, accomplished his spirited, eloquent, generous&mdash;the
      forerunners of Charles Surfor. Marriage retrieves them and turns them into
      respectable and adoring husbands. Though rattle-brained, much given to
      gallantry, and somewhat lax in morality, they are not knaves or monsters;
      they do not inspire disgust. Even the lumpish blockhead, Squire Sullen&mdash;according
      to Macaulay a type of the main strength of the Tory party for half a
      century after the Revolution&mdash;contrasts favourably with his prototype
      Sir John Brute in Vanbrugh's <i><b>Provoked Wife</b></i>, He is a sodden
      sot, who always goes to bed drunk, but he is not a demon; he does not beat
      his wife in public; he observes common decency somewhat. His wife is a
      witty, attractive, warm-hearted woman, whose faults are transparent; the
      chief one being that she has made the fatal mistake of marrying for
      fortune and position instead of for love. There is something pathetic in
      her position which claims our sympathy. She is well contrasted with her
      sister-in-law, the sincere, though somewhat weakly drawn, Dorinda; whilst
      their mother-in-law, Lady Bountiful, famed for her charity, is an amusing
      and gracious figure, which has often been copied. Cherry, with her honest
      heart and her quickness of perception, is also a distinct creation.
      Strange to say, the only badly drawn character is Foigard, the
      unscrupulous Irish Jesuit priest. Farquhar is fond of introducing an
      Irishman into each of his plays, but I cannot say that I think he is
      generally successful; certainly not in this instance. They are mostly
      broad caricatures, and speak an outlandish jargon, more like Welsh than
      Irish, supposed to be the Ulster dialect: anything more unlike it would be
      difficult to conceive. The early conventional stage Irishman, tracing him
      from Captain. Macmorris <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/f011.png">[xi]</a></span>in
      Henry V.,through Ben Jonson's <i><b>Irish Masque</b></i> and <i><b>New Inn</b></i>,
      Dekker's Bryan, Ford's Mayor of Cork, Shadwell's O'Divelly (probably
      Farquhar's model for Foigard), is truly a wondrous savage, chiefly
      distinguished by his use of the expletives 'Dear Joy!' and 'By Creesh!'
      This character naturally rendered the play somewhat unpopular in Ireland,
      and its repulsiveness is unrelieved (as it is in the case of Teague in <i><b>The
      Twin Rivals</b></i>) by a single touch of humour or native comicality. It
      is an outrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>The First Performance</b></i>. <i><b>The Beaux-Stratagem</b></i> was
      first performed on Saturday, 8th March 1707, at the Theatre Royal (or, as
      it was sometimes called, the Queen's Theatre), situated in the Haymarket,
      on the site afterwards occupied by Her Majesty's Theatre. It ran for ten
      nights only, owing to benefits. The cast on that occasion was a strong
      one. Robert Wilks (a brother-Irishman), who performed Archer, was the
      foremost actor of the day. He was Farquhar's lifelong friend, and appeared
      in all his plays, except <i><b>Love and a Bottle</b></i> which was
      produced in London during Wilks's absence in Dublin. This actor's most
      famous part was 'Sir Harry Wildair' (<i><b>The Constant Couple</b></i>),
      which our author drew on purpose for him, and which ran for fifty-two
      nights on its first appearance. Farquhar himself said that when the stage
      had the misfortune to lose Wilks, 'Sir Harry Wildair' might go to the
      Jubilee! Peg Woffington is said to have been his only rival in this part.
      Sullen was the last original character undertaken by Verbruggen, a leading
      actor of the time. It was from Verbruggen's wife (probably the 'Mrs. V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'
      of Farquhar's letters) that the famous Mrs. Oldfield received her earliest
      instructions in acting. The last-named lady was the original Mrs. Sullen.
      Her connection <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/f012.png">[xii]</a></span>with
      Farquhar is very interesting and romantic. She resided with her aunt, Mrs.
      Voss, who kept the Mitre Tavern in St, James's Market (between Jeryrm
      Street, Regent Street, and the Haymarket). One day, when she was aged
      sixteen, Farquhar, a smart young captain of twenty-two, happened to be
      dining there, and he overheard her reading Beaumont and Fletcher's <i><b>Scornful
      Lady</b></i> aloud behind the bar. When Farquhar, much struck by her
      musical delivery and expression, pressed her to resume her reading, the
      tall and graceful girl consented with hesitation and bashfulness; although
      she afterwards confessed, 'I longed to be at it, and only needed a decent
      entreaty.' The dramatist quickly acquainted Sir John Vanbrugh with the
      jewel he had thus accidentally found, and she obtained through him an
      engagement at the Theatre Royal as 'Candiope' in Dryden's <i><b>Secret
      Love</b></i>. She soon became the fine lady of the stage, and was the
      original representative of no less than sixty-five characters. Pope
      disliked and satirised her severely; on the other hand, Cibber worshipped
      her. According to some, Farquhar fell violently in love with her, and she
      is the 'Penelope' of his letters; but although she often spoke of the
      happy hours she spent in his company, there appears to be no foundation
      for this surmise. Bowen, a low comedian of considerable talent, afterwards
      accidentally killed by Quin the actor, was Foigard; and Scrub&mdash;originally
      written for Colley Cibber, who, however, preferred Gibbet&mdash;was
      represented by Norris, a capital comic actor, universally known as
      'Jubilee Dicky' on account of his representation of 'Dicky' in <i><b>The
      Constant Couple</b></i>. He had an odd, formal little figure, and a high
      squeaking voice; if he came into a coffee-house and merely called
      'Waiter!' everybody present felt inclined to laugh. He had previously
      appeared in Farquhar's four principal plays, as <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/f013.png">[xiii]</a></span>also had Mills, who did Aimwell.
      Cibber tells us that the play was better received at Drury Lane than at
      the Haymarket, as, owing to the larger size of the latter house, it was
      difficult to hear.

      <i><b>Later Stage History</b></i>. Originally brought out under the title
      <i><b>The Stratagem</b></i> only, which it retained in the playbills till
      1787 (though printed with 'Beaux'), this play continued to be very popular
      with the stage down to the dawn of the present century; and many great
      actors and actresses appeared from time to time in its characters; In 1721
      Quin acted in Lincoln's Inn Fields as Squire Sullen. The part of Mrs.
      Sullen has been undertaken by Mrs. Pritchard (1740 and 1761), Peg
      Woffington (1742, along with Garrick as Archer for the first time, and
      Macklin as Scrub), Mrs. Abington (1774, 1785, 1798), Mrs. Barry (1778),
      Miss Farren (1779), Mrs. Jordan (1802), Mrs. C. Kemble (1810), Mrs.
      Davison (1818), and Miss Chester (1823, for Dibdin's benefit, with Liston
      as Scrub). Garrick's repeated performances of Archer, in light blue and
      silver livery, were supremely good, more particularly in the scenes with
      Cherry, the picture scene with Mrs. Sullen, and when he delivers Lady
      Howd'ye's message. He generally acted with Weston, an inimitable Scrub;
      but at O'Brien's benefit at Drury Lane, 10th April 1761, Garrick himself
      played Scrub to O'Brien's Archer. On one occasion Garrick had refused
      Weston a loan of money, and Weston not appearing at the greenroom, Garrick
      came forward before the curtain and announced that he would himself play
      Scrub, as Weston was ill. Weston, who was in the gallery with a sham
      bailiff, shouted out, 'I am here, but the bailiff won't let me come ';
      whereupon the audience insisted on Garrick's paying the loan and relieving
      the debtor so as to <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/f014.png">[xiv]</a></span>enable
      him to play Scrub! Other famous Scrubs were Shutes (1774), Quick (1778,
      1785, 1798), Bannister, junior (1802, will C. Kemble as Aimwell), Dowton
      (1802), Liston (1810), Johnstone (1821), and Keeley (1828, with C. Kemble
      as Arches and Miss Foote as Cherry; it ran for twelve nights at Covenl
      Garden). Goldsmith is said to have expressed a desire to art this part. On
      the occasion of Mrs. Abington's benefit (Covenl Garden, November 19,
      1785), she took the part of Scrub for that night only, for a wager, it is
      said. Ladies were desired to send their servants to retain seats by four
      o'clock, and the pit and boxes were laid together. She disgraced herself,
      acting the part with her hair dressed for 'Lady Racket' in the afterpiece
      (<i><b>Three Hours After Marriage</b></i>). In April 1823 another female
      impersonator of this part appeared&mdash;not very successfully&mdash;in
      Miss Clara Fisher, with Farren as Archer. This was in Dublin (Hawkins'
      Street), where the play was frequently performed about 1821-1823. It was
      also the piece chosen for the re-opening of Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin,
      in 1759, when Mrs. Abington made her first appearance on the Irish stage
      as Mrs. Sullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pope (1774), Mrs. Martyn (1785, 1798), and Mrs. Gibbs (1819) were the
      principal exponents of Cherry. In 1819 Emery did Gibbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      About 1810 the play was performed at the Royal Circus under Elliston as a
      <i><b>ballet d'action</b></i>, in order to evade the Patent Act.
      Otherwise, neither this play nor any other of Farquhar's seems ever to
      have been 'adapted' for the modern stage. In the present half-century <i><b>The
      Beaux-Stratagem</b></i> has been but seldom performed. It was acted in
      London in 1856. In February 1878 Mr. Phelps gave it extremely well in the
      Annexe Theatre at the Westminster Aquarium. Lastly, William Farren, as
      Archer, revived it at the Imperial Theatre, on Monday, 22nd <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/f015.png">[xv]</a></span>September 1879,
      with great success, a new Prologue (spoken by Mrs. Stirling) being written
      for the occasion. There were several matinees given in succession. The
      cast included Mr. Kyrle Bellew as Gibbet; Mr. Lionel Brough as Scrub; Miss
      Marie Litton as Mrs. Sullen; Mrs. Stirling&mdash;one of her last
      appearances&mdash;as Lady Bountiful; Dorinda, Miss Meyrick; Cherry, Miss
      Carlotta Addison; Gipsy, Miss Passinger; Aimwell, Mr. Edgar; Sir Charles
      Freeman, Mr. Denny; Sullen, Mr. Ryder; Foigard, Mr. Bannister; Boniface,
      Mr. Everill; Hounslow, Mr. Bunch; Bagshot, Mr. Leitch. The Epilogue for
      this occasion was written by Mr. Clement Scott. I know not if the play has
      been acted since that date.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bibliography</b></i>. The first edition was published in a small
      quarto (78 pages) by Bernard Lintott, 'at the Cross-Keys next Nando's
      Coffeehouse in Fleet Street' between the two Temple gates. The British
      Museum Catalogue dates it 1707 (the copy in my possession, however, bears
      no date), but it is supposed not to have been published till 1710, three
      years after Farquhar's decease; whence some have erroneously dated his
      death in that year. Lintott, on January 27, 1707, had paid the dramatist
      £30. in advance for this play, double what he usually gave for a play. The
      same publisher issued the first complete edition of Farquhar's plays in an
      octavo volume, dedicated to John Eyre, with a quaint illustration prefixed
      to each play (we reproduce that prefixed to <i><b>The Beaux-Stratagem</b></i>),
      introducing all the characters of the play, and a frontispiece
      representing Farquhar being presented to Apollo by Ben Jonson. The general
      title-page is undated, but the title-pages of the various plays bear the
      date 1711, and all bear Lintott's name (sometimes alone, sometimes with
      others) save <i><b>Sir Harry <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/f016.png">[xvi]</a></span>Wildair</b></i>, which is said to
      be printed by James Knapton. Some say this volume did not appear till
      1714. In 1760 Rivington published an edition of Farquhar which appears to
      be slightly 'bowdlerised.' At least two complete editions of his works
      were published in Dublin; one, described as the seventh, in two volumes
      small octavo, by Risk and Smith, in 1743 (including a memoir, and <i><b>Love
      and Business</b></i>), in which the title-pages of the various plays bear
      different dates, ranging from 1727 to 1741, <i><b>The Beaux-Stratagem</b></i>
      being described as the twelfth edition, and dated 1739; the other,
      charmingly printed by Ewing in three 16mo volumes, dated 1775, with a
      vignette portrait and other illustrations, and containing a life by Thomas
      Wilkes. An Edinburgh edition of The <i><b>Beaux-Stratagem</b></i>, with
      life, appeared in 1768, and an edition in German in 1782 by J. Leonhardi,
      under the title <i><b>Die Stutzerlist</b></i>. Separate editions of the
      play also appeared in 1748, 1778, and 1824 (New York), and it is included
      in all the various collections of English plays, such as Bell's,
      Oxberry's, Inchbald's, Dibdin's, Cumberland's, etc., and in the collected
      editions of Farquhar's works dated 1718, 1728, 1736, 1742, 1760, and 1772.
      The principal modern editions of Farquhar are Leigh Hunt's (along with
      Wycherley, Vanbrugh, and Congreve), and Ewald's (1892), in two volumes
      large octavo.

      The reader may find some faults in this play, which my illness prevented
      the amending of; but there is great amends made in the representation,
      which cannot be matched, no more than the friendly and indefatigable care

    <p>
      WHEN strife disturbs, or sloth corrupts an age, Keen satire is the
      business of the stage. When the <i><b>Plain-Dealer</b></i> writ, he lash'd
      those crimes, Which then infested most&mdash;the modish times: But now,
      when faction sleeps, and sloth is fled, And all our youth in active fields
      are bred; When through Great Britain's fair extensive round, The trumps of
      fame, the notes of UNION sound; When Anna's sceptre points the laws their
      course, And her example gives her precepts force: <span class="linenum">[10]</span>
      There scarce is room for satire; all our lays Must be, or songs of
      triumph, or of praise. But as in grounds best cultivated, tares And
      poppies rise among the golden ears; Our product so, fit for the field or
      school, Must mix with nature's favourite plant&mdash;a fool: A weed that
      has to twenty summers ran, Shoots up in stalk, and vegetates to man.
      Simpling our author goes from field to field, And culls such fools as many
      diversion yield <span class="linenum">[20]</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p004.png">[4]</a></span>And, thanks to Nature, there's no
      want of those, For rain or shine, the thriving coxcomb grows. Follies
      to-night we show ne'er lash'd before, Yet such as nature shows you every
      hour; Nor can the pictures give a just offence, For fools are made for
      jests to men of sense.

      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. Sir, I have now in my cellar ten tun of the best ale in

      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. [Drinks,] 'Tis confounded strong!

      drink it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. And have you lived so long upon this ale, landlord?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. Eight-and-fifty years, upon my credit, sir&mdash;but it
      killed my wife, poor woman, as the saying is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. How came that to pass?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. I don't know how, sir; she would not let the ale take
      its natural course, sir; she was for qualifying it every now and then with
      a dram, as the saying <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p008.png">[8]</a></span>is;
      and an honest gentleman that came this way from Ireland, made her a
      present of a dozen bottles of usquebaugh&mdash;but the poor woman was
      never well after: but, howe'er, I was obliged to the gentleman, you know.
      <span class="linenum">[66]</span>

    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Why, was it the usquebaugh that killed her?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. My Lady Bountiful said so. She, good lady, did what
      could be done; she cured her of three tympanies, but the fourth carried
      her off. But she's happy, and I 'm contented, as the saying is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Who 's that Lady Bountiful you mentioned?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. 'Ods my life, sir, we'll drink her health.&mdash;[Drinks.]
      My Lady Bountiful is one of the best of women. Her last husband, Sir
      Charles Bountiful, left her worth a thousand pound, a year; and, I
      believe, she lays out one-half on't in charitable uses for the good of her
      neighbours. She cures rheumatisms, ruptures, and broken shins in men;
      green-sickness, obstructions, and fits of the mother, in women; the king's
      evil, chincough, and chilblains, in children: in short, she has cured more
      people in and about Lichfield within ten years than the doctors have
      killed in twenty; and that's a bold word. <span class="linenum">[84]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Has the lady been any other way useful in her
      generation?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. Yes, sir; she has a daughter by Sir Charles, the finest
      woman in all our country, and the greatest <i><b>fortune</b></i>. She has
      a son too, by her first husband, <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p009.png">[9]</a></span>Squire Sullen, who married a fine
      lady from London t' other day; if you please, sir, we 'll drink his
      health.

    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. What sort of a man is he? <span class="linenum">[92]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. Why, sir, the man 's well enough; says little, thinks
      less, and does&mdash;nothing at all, faith. But he's a man of a great
      estate, and values nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. A sportsman, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. Yes, sir, he's a man of pleasure; he plays at whisk and
      smokes his pipe eight-and-forty hours together sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. And married, you say? <span class="linenum">[100]</span>
    </p>
    <p>

      wants it here, sir. [<i><b>Pointing to his forehead</b></i>.

    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. He has it there, you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. That's none of my business; he's my landlord, and so a
      man, you know, would not&mdash;But&mdash;ecod, he's no better than&mdash;Sir,
      my humble service to you.&mdash; [<i><b>Drinks</b></i>.] Though I value
      not a farthing what he can do to me; I pay him his rent at quarter-day; I
      have a good running-trade; I have but one daughter, and I can give her&mdash;but
      no matter for that. <span class="linenum">[111]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. You're very happy, Mr. Boniface. Pray, what other
      company have you in town?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. A power of fine ladies; and then we have the French
      officers.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p010.png">[10]</a></span><i><b>Bon</b></i>.
      So well, as the saying is, that I could wish we had as many more of'em;
      they're full of money, and pay double for everything they have. They know,
      sir, that we paid good round taxes for the taking of 'em, and so they are
      willing to reimburse us a little. One of 'em lodges in my house. <span

    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Landlord, there are some French gentlemen below that
      ask for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. I'll wait on 'em.&mdash;[<i><b>Aside to Archer</b></i>.]
      Does your master stay long in town, as the saying is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. I can't tell, as the saying is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. Come from London?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. No. <span class="linenum">[130]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. Going to London, mayhap?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. [<i><b>Aside</b></i>.] An odd fellow this.&mdash;[<i><b>To
      Aimwell</b></i>.] I beg your worship's pardon, I 'll wait on you in half a
      minute. [<i><b>Exit</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. The coast's clear, I see.&mdash;Now, my dear Archer,
      welcome to Lichfield!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. I thank thee, my dear brother in iniquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Iniquity! prithee, leave canting; you need not change
      your style with your dress. <span class="linenum">[140]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Don't mistake me, Aimwell, for 'tis still my <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p011.png">[11]</a></span>maxim, that
      there is no scandal like rags, nor any crime so shameful as poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. The world confesses it every day in its practice though
      men won't own it for their opinion. Who did that worthy lord my brother,
      single out of the side-box to sup with him t' other night?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Jack Handicraft, a handsome, well-dressed, mannerly,
      sharping rogue, who keeps the best company in town. <span class="linenum">[150]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Right!' And, pray, who married my lady Manslaughter
      t'other day, the great fortune?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Why, Nick Marrabone, a professed pickpocket, and a
      good bowler; but he makes a handsome figure, and rides in his coach, that
      he formerly used to ride behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. But did you observe poor Jack Generous in the Park last
      week.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Yes, with his autumnal periwig, shading his melancholy
      face, his coat older than anything but its fashion, with one hand idle in
      his pocket, and with the other picking his useless teeth; and, though the
      Mall was crowded with company, yet was poor Jack as single and solitary as
      a lion in a desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. And as much avoided for no crime upon earth but the
      want of money. <span class="linenum">[166]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. And that's enough. Men must not be poor; idleness is
      the root of all evil; the world's wide enough, let 'em bustle. Fortune has
      taken the weak <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p012.png">[12]</a></span>under
      her protection, but men of sense are left to their industry. <span
      class="linenum">[171]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Upon which topic we proceed, and, I think, luckily
      hitherto. Would not any man swear now, that I am a man of quality, and you
      my servant, when if our intrinsic value were known&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Come, come, we are the men of intrinsic value who can
      strike our fortunes out of ourselves, whose worth is independent of
      accidents in life, or revolutions in government: we have heads to get
      money and hearts to spend it. <span class="linenum">[180]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. As to pur hearts, I grant ye, they are as willing tits
      as any within twenty degrees: but I can have no great opinion of our heads
      from the service they have done us hitherto, unless it be that they have
      brought us from London hither to Lichfield, made me a lord and you my
      servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. That 's more than you could expect already. But what
      money have we left?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. But two hundred pound. <span class="linenum">[189]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. And our horses, clothes, rings, etc.&mdash;Why, we
      have very good fortunes now for moderate people; and, let me tell you,
      that this two hundred pound, with the experience that we are now masters
      of, is a better estate than the ten we have spent&mdash;Our friends,
      indeed, began to suspect that our pockets were low, but we came off with
      flying colours, showed no signs of want either in word or deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p013.png">[13]</a></span><i><b>Aim</b></i>.
      Ay, and our going to Brussels was a good pretence enough for our sudden
      disappearing; and, I warrant you, our friends imagine that we are gone
      a-volunteering. <span class="linenum">[201]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Why, faith, if this prospect fails, it must e'en come
      to that I am for venturing one of the hundreds, if you will, upon this
      knight-errantry; but, in case it should fail, we 'll reserve t' other to
      carry us to some counterscarp, where we may die, as we lived, in a blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. With all my heart; and we have lived justly, Archer: we
      can't say that we have spent our fortunes, but that we have enjoyed 'em.
      <span class="linenum">[210]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Right! so much pleasure for so much money. We have had
      our pennyworths; and, had I millions, I would go to the same market again.&mdash;O
      London! London!&mdash;Well, we have had our share, and let us be thankful:
      past pleasures, for aught I know, are best, such as we are sure of; those
      to come may disappoint us. <span class="linenum">[217]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. It has often grieved the heart of me to see how some
      inhuman wretches murder their kind fortunes; those that, by sacrificing
      all to one appetite, shall starve all the rest. You shall have some that
      live only in their palates, and in their sense of tasting shall drown the
      other four: others are only epicures in appearances, such who shall starve
      their nights to make a figure a days, and famish their own to feed <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p014.png">[14]</a></span>the eyes of
      others: a contrary sort confine their pleasures to the dark, and contract
      their specious acres to the circuit of a muff-string. <span class="linenum">[228]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Right! But they find the Indies in that spot where
      they consume 'em, and I think your kind keepers have much the best on't:
      for they indulge the most senses by one expense, there's the seeing,
      hearing, and feeling, amply gratified; and, some philosophers will tell
      you, that from such a commerce there arises a sixth sense, that gives
      infinitely more pleasure than the other five put together, <span
      class="linenum">[237]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. And to pass to the other extremity, of all keepers I
      think those the worst that keep their money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Those are the most miserable wights in being, they
      destroy the rights of nature, and disappoint the blessings of Providence.
      Give me a man that keeps his five senses keen and bright as his sword,
      that has 'em always drawn out in their just order and strength, with his
      reason as commander at the head of 'em, that detaches 'em by turns upon
      whatever party of pleasure agreeably offers, and commands 'em to retreat
      upon the least appearance of disadvantage or danger! For my part, I can
      stick to my bottle while my wine, my company, and my reason, hold good; I
      can be charmed with Sappho's singing without falling in love with her
      face: I love hunting, but would not, like Actæon, be eaten up by my own
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p015.png">[15]</a></span>dogs; I
      love a fine house, but let another keep it; and just so I love a fine
      woman. <span class="linenum">[255]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. In that last particular you have the better of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Ay, you're such an amorous puppy, that I'm afraid you
      'll spoil our sport; you can't counterfeit the passion without feeling it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Though the whining part be out of doors in town, 'tis
      still in force with the country ladies: and let me tell you, Frank, the
      fool in that passion shall-outdo the knave at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Well, I won't dispute it now; you command for the day,
      and so I submit: at Nottingham, you know, I am to be master. <span
      class="linenum">[266]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. And at Lincoln, I again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Then, at Norwich I mount, which, I think, shall be our
      last stage; for, if we fail there, we'll embark for Holland, bid adieu to
      Venus, and welcome Mars.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. A match!&mdash;Mum!

    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. What have you got?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. Sir, we have a delicate piece of beef in the pot, and a
      pig at the fire.

      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Have you got any fish or wildfowl? <span class="linenum">[287]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. As for fish, truly, sir, we are an inland town, and
      indifferently provided with fish, that 's the truth on't; and then for
      wildfowl&mdash;we have a delicate couple of rabbits. <span class="linenum">[291]</span>

      smothered with onions.

    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Psha! Damn your onions!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Again, sirrah!&mdash;Well, landlord, what you please.
      But hold, I have a small charge of money, and your house is so full of
      strangers that I believe it may be safer in your custody than mine; for

      [<i><b>Brings Aimwell the box</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Here, landlord; the locks are sealed down both for your

      it I'll <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p017.png">[17]</a></span>count
      it to you after supper; but be sure you lay it where I may have it at a
      minute's warning; for my affairs are a little dubious at present; perhaps
      I may be gone in half an hour, perhaps I may be your guest till the best
      part of that be spent; and pray order your ostler to keep my horses always
      saddled. But one thing above the rest I must beg, that you would let this
      fellow have none of your <i><b>Anno Domini</b></i>, as you call it; for

      ACT II., SCENE I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i><b>A Gallery in Lady Bountifuls House</b></i>. <i><b>Enter Mrs. Sullen
      and Dorinda, meeting</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. Morrow, my dear sister; are you for church this
      morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. Anywhere to pray; for Heaven alone can help me.
      But I think, Dorinda, there's no form of prayer in the liturgy against bad
      husbands:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. But there's a form of law in Doctors-Common and I
      swear, sister Sullen, rather than see you this continually discontented, I
      would advise you apply to that: for besides the part that I bear your
      vexatious broils, as being sister to the husband and friend to the wife,
      your example gives me such an impression of matrimony, that I shall be apt
      condemn my person to a long vacation all its life But supposing, madam,
      that you brought it to case of separation, what can you urge against your
      husband? My brother is, first, the most constant man alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p023.png">[23]</a></span><i><b>Mrs.
      Sul</b></i>. The most constant husband, I grant ye.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. He never sleeps from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. No, he always sleeps with me. <span class="linenum">[20]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. He allows you a maintenance suitable to your quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. A maintenance! do you take me, madam, for an
      hospital child, that I must sit down, and bless my benefactors for meat,
      drink, and clothes? As I take it, madam, I brought your brother ten
      thousand pounds, out of which I might expect some pretty things, called
      pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. You share in all the pleasures that the country
      affords. <span class="linenum">[30]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. Country pleasures! racks and torments! Dost think,
      child, that my limbs were made for leaping of ditches, and clambering over
      stiles? or that my parents, wisely foreseeing my future happiness in
      country pleasures, had early instructed me in rural accomplishments of
      drinking fat ale, playing at whisk, and smoking tobacco with my husband?
      or of spreading of plasters, brewing of diet-drinks, and stilling
      rosemary-water, with the good old gentlewoman my mother-in-law? <span
      class="linenum">[40]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. I'm sorry, madam, that it is not more in our power to
      divert you; I could wish, indeed, that our entertainments were a little
      more polite, or your taste a little less refined. But, pray, madam, how
      came the poets and philosophers, that laboured so <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p024.png">[24]</a></span>much in hunting after pleasure, to
      place it at last in a country life? <span class="linenum">[47]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. Because they wanted money, child, to find out the
      pleasures of the town. Did you ever see a poet or philosopher worth ten
      thousand pounds? if you can show me such a man, I 'll lay you fifty pounds
      you'll find him somewhere within the weekly bills. Not that I disapprove
      rural pleasures, as the poets have painted them; in their landscape, every
      Phillis has her Corydon, every murmuring stream, and every flowery mead,
      gives fresh alarms to love. Besides, you'll find, that their couples were
      never married:&mdash;but yonder I see my Corydon, and a sweet swain it is,
      Heaven knows! Come, Dorinda, don't be angry, he's my husband, and your
      brother; and, between both, is he not a sad brute? <span class="linenum">[62]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. I have nothing to say to your part of him, you 're the
      best judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. O sister, sister! if ever you marry, beware of a
      sullen, silent sot, one that's always musing, but never thinks. There's
      some diversion in a talking blockhead; and since a woman must wear chains,
      I would have the pleasure of hearing 'em rattle a little. Now you shall
      see, but take this by the way. He came home this morning at his usual hour
      of four, wakened me out of a sweet dream of something else, by tumbling
      over the tea-table, which he <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p025.png">[25]</a></span>broke all to pieces; after his man
      and he had rolled about the room, like sick passengers in a storm, he
      comes flounce into bed, dead as a salmon into a fishmonger's basket; his
      feet cold as ice, his breath hot as a furnace, and his hands and his face
      as greasy as his flannel night-cap. O matrimony! He tosses up the clothes
      with a barbarous swing over his shoulders, disorders the whole economy of
      my bed, leaves me half naked, and my whole night's comfort is the tuneable
      serenade of that wakeful nightingale, his nose! Oh, the pleasure of
      counting the melancholy clock by a snoring husband! But now, sister, you
      shall see how handsomely, being a well-bred man, he will beg my pardon.

    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Sir! <span class="linenum">[118]</span>

    <p>
      <i><b>Squire Sul</b></i>. Get things ready to shave my head. [<i><b>Exit</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. Have a care of coming near his temples, Scrub, for
      fear you meet something there that may <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p027.png">[27]</a></span>turn the edge of your razor.&mdash;[<i><b>Exit
      Scrub</b></i>.] Inveterate stupidity I did you ever know so hard, so
      obstinate a spleen as his? O sister, sister! I shall never ha' good of the
      beast till I get him to town; London, dear London, is the place for
      managing and breaking a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. And has not a husband the same opportunities there for
      humbling a wife? <span class="linenum">[129]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. No, no, child, 'tis a standing maxim in conjugal
      discipline, that when a man would enslave his wife, he hurries her into
      the country; and when a lady would be arbitrary with her husband, she
      wheedles her booby up to town. A man dare not play the tyrant in London,
      because there are so many examples to encourage the subject to rebel. O
      Dorinda! Dorinda! a fine woman may do anything in London: o' my
      conscience, she may raise an army of forty thousand men. <span
      class="linenum">[139]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. I fancy, sister, you have a mind to be trying your
      power that way here in Lichfield; you have drawn the French count to your
      colours already.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. The French are a people that can't live without
      their gallantries.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. And some English that I know, sister, are not averse to
      such amusements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. Well, sister, since the truth must out, it may do
      as well now as hereafter; I think, one way to rouse my lethargic, sottish
      husband, is to give him <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p028.png">[28]</a></span>a
      rival: security begets negligence in all people, and men must be alarmed
      to make 'em alert-in their duty. Women are like pictures, of no value in
      the hands of a fool, till he hears men of sense bid high for the purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. This might do, sister, if my brother's understanding
      were to be convinced into a passion for you; but, I fancy, there's a
      natural aversion on his side; and I fancy, sister, that you don't come
      much behind him, if you dealt fairly. <span class="linenum">[159]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. I own it, we are united contradictions, fire and
      water: but I could be contented, with a great many other wives, to humour
      the censorious mob, and give the world an appearance of living well with
      my husband, could I bring him but to dissemble a little kindness to keep
      me in countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. But how do you know, sister, but that, instead of
      rousing your husband by this artifice to a counterfeit kindness, he should
      awake in a real fury?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. Let him: if I can't entice him to the one, I would
      provoke him to the other. <span class="linenum">[170]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. But how must I behave myself between ye?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. You must assist me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. What, against my own brother?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. He's but half a brother, and I 'm your entire
      friend. If I go a step beyond the bounds of honour, leave me; till then, I
      expect you should go along with me in everything; while I trust my honour
      in your <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p029.png">[29]</a></span>hands,
      you may trust your brother's in mine. The count is to dine here to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. 'Tis a strange thing, sister, that I can't like that
      man. <span class="linenum">[181]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. You like nothing; your time is not come; Love and
      Death have their fatalities, and strike home one time or other: you 'll
      pay for all one day, I warrant ye. But come, my lady's tea is ready, and

      <i><b>A Room in Boniface's Inn</b></i>. <i><b>Enter Aimwell dressed, and
      Archer</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. And was she the daughter of the house?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. The landlord is so blind as to think so; but I dare
      swear she has better blood in her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Why dost think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Because the baggage has a pert <i><b>je ne sais quoi</b></i>;
      she reads plays, keeps a monkey, and is troubled with vapours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. By which discoveries I guess that you know more of <i><b>Cher</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Not yet, faith; the lady gives herself airs; forsooth,
      nothing under a gentleman!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p030.png">[30]</a></span><i><b>Aim</b></i>.
      Let me take her in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Say one word more of that, and I'll declare myself,
      spoil your sport there, and everywhere else; look ye, Aim well, every man
      in his own sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Right; and therefore you must pimp for your master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. In the usual forms, good sir, after I have served
      myself.&mdash;But to our business. You are so well dressed, Tom, and make
      so handsome a figure, that I fancy you may do execution in a country
      church; the exterior part strikes first, and you're in the right to make
      that impression favourable. <span class="linenum">[23]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. There's something in that which may turn to advantage.
      The appearance of a stranger in a country church draws as many gazers as a
      blazing-star; no sooner he comes into the cathedral, but a train of
      whispers runs buzzing round the congregation in a moment: <i><b>Who is he?
      Whence comes he? Do you know him?</b></i>Then I, sir, tips me the verger
      with half-a-crown; he pockets the simony, and inducts me into the best pew
      in the church; I pull out my snuff-box, turn myself round, bow to the
      bishop, or the dean, if he be the commanding-officer; single out a beauty,
      rivet both my eyes to hers, set my nose a-bleeding by the strength of
      imagination, and show the whole church my concern, by my endeavouring to
      hide it; after the sermon, the whole town gives me to her for a lover,
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p031.png">[31]</a></span>and by
      persuading the lady that I am a-dying for her, the tables are turned, and
      she in good earnest falls in love with me. <span class="linenum">[42]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. There's nothing in this, Tom, without a precedent; but
      instead of riveting your eyes to a beauty, try to fix 'em upon a fortune;
      that's our business at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Psha! no woman can be a beauty without a fortune. Let
      me alone, for I am a marksman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Tom!

    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Ay. <span class="linenum">[50]</span>

      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Um&mdash;I was there at the coronation.

    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. And how can you expect a blessing by going to church
      now?

      wheedling.

    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. Young! why, you jade, as the saying is, can any woman
      wheedle that is not young? your mother was useless at five-and-twenty. Not
      wheedle! <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p032.png">[32]</a></span>would
      you make your mother a whore, and me a cuckold, as the saying is? I tell
      you, his silence confesses it, and his master spends his money so freely,

    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Gib</b></i>. No matter, ask no questions, all fair and honourable.&mdash;Here,
      my dear Cherry.&mdash;[<i><b>Gives her a bag</b></i>.] Two hundred
      sterling pounds, as good as any that ever hanged or saved a rogue; lay 'em
      by with the rest; and here-three wedding or mourning rings, 'tis much the
      same you know-here, two silver-hilted swords; I took those from fellows
      that never show any part of their swords but the hilts-here is a diamond
      necklace which the lady hid in the privatest place in the coach, but I
      found it out&mdash; this gold watch I took from a pawnbroker's wife; it
      was left in her hands by a person of quality: there's the arms upon the
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. But who had you the money from? <span class="linenum">[86]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Gib</b></i>. Ah! poor woman! I pitied her;-from a poor lady just
      eloped from her husband. She had made up her cargo, and was bound for
      Ireland, as hard as she could drive; she told me of her husband's
      barbarous usage, and so I left her half-a-crown. <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p033.png">[33]</a></span>But I had almost forgot, my dear
      Cherry, I have a present for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. What is 't?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Gib</b></i>. A pot of ceruse, my child, that I took out of a lady's
      under-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. What, Mr. Gibbet, do you think that I paint?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Gib</b></i>. Why, you jade, your betters do; I 'm sure the lady that
      I took it from had a coronet upon her handkerchief. Here, take my cloak,
      and go, secure the premises. <span class="linenum">[101]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. I will secure 'em. [<i><b>Exit</b></i>.

    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. But, hark'ee, where's Hounslow and Bagshot?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Gib</b></i>. They'll be here to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. D' ye know of any other gentlemen o' the pad on this
      road?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Gib</b></i>. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. I fancy that I have two that lodge in the house just
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Gib</b></i>. The devil! how d'ye smoke 'em? <span class="linenum">[110]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. Why, the one is gone to church.

    <p>
      <i><b>Gib</b></i>. That's suspicious, I must confess.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. And the other is now in his master's chamber; he
      pretends to be servant to the other; we 'll call him out and pump him a
      little.

      I won't tell ye. <span class="linenum">[170]</span>

    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. What are the objects of that passion?

    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. Youth, beauty, and clean linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. The reason?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. The two first are fashionable in nature, and the third
      at court.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. That's my dear.&mdash;What are the signs and tokens of
      that passion?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. A stealing look, a stammering tongue, words
      improbable, designs impossible, and actions impracticable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="linenum">[180]</span> <i><b>Arch</b></i>. That's my good
      child, kiss me.&mdash;-What must a lover do to obtain his mistress?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. He must adore the person that disdains him, he must
      bribe the chambermaid that betrays him, and court the footman that laughs
      at him. He must&mdash;he must&mdash;

      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Nay, child, I must whip you if you don't mind your

    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. Oh ay!&mdash;he must treat his enemies with respect,
      his friends with indifference, and all the world with contempt; he must
      suffer much, and fear more; he must desire much, and hope little; in
      short, he must embrace his ruin, and throw himself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Had ever man so hopeful a pupil as mine!&mdash; Come,
      my dear, why is love called a riddle?

    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. Because, being blind, he leads those that see, and,
      though a child, he governs a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p037.png">[37]</a></span><i><b>Arch</b></i>.
      Mighty well!&mdash;And why is Love pictured blind?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. Because the painters out of the weakness or privilege
      of their art chose to hide those eyes that they could not draw. <span

    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. That's my dear little scholar, kiss me again.&mdash;
      And why should Love, that's a child, govern a man?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. Because that a child is the end of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. And so ends Love's catechism.&mdash;And now, my dear,
      we'll go in and make my master's bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. Hold, hold, Mr. Martin! You have taken a great deal of
      pains to instruct me, and what d' ye think I have learned by it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. What? <span class="linenum">[209]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. That your discourse and your habit are contradictions,
      and it would be nonsense in me to believe you a footman any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. 'Oons, what a witch it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. Depend upon this, sir, nothing in this garb shall ever
      tempt me; for, though I was born to servitude, I hate it. Own your
      condition, swear you love me, and then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. And then we shall go make my master's bed?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. Yes. <span class="linenum">[219]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. You must know, then, that I am born a gentleman, my
      education was liberal; but I went to London a younger brother, fell into
      the hands of sharpers, who stripped me of my money, my friends <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p038.png">[38]</a></span>disowned me,
      and now my necessity brings me to what you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. Then take my hand&mdash;promise to marry me before you
      sleep, and I'll make you master of two thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. How! <span class="linenum">[229]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. Two thousand pounds that I have this minute in my own
      custody; so, throw off your livery this instant, and I 'll go find a
      parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. What said you? a parson!

    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. What! do you scruple?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Scruple! no, no, but&mdash;Two thousand pounds, you
      say?

      But hark 'ee, child, what need you make me master of yourself and money,
      when you may have the same pleasure out of me, and still keep your fortune
      in your hands?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. Then you won't marry me? <span class="linenum">[242]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. I would marry you, but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. O sweet sir, I'm your humble servant, you're fairly
      caught! Would you persuade me that any gentleman who could bear the
      scandal of wearing a livery would refuse two thousand pounds, let the
      condition be what it would? no, no, sir. But I hope you 'll pardon the
      freedom I have taken, since it was only to inform myself of the respect
      that I ought to pay you. [<i><b>Going</b></i>.

    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Cher</b></i>. Sir, I have my secrets as well as you; when you please
      to be more open I shall be more free, and be assured that I have
      discoveries that will match yours, be what they will. In the meanwhile, be
      satisfied that no discovery I make shall ever hurt you, but beware of my
      father! [<i><b>Exit</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. So! we're like to have as many adventures in our inn
      as Don Quixote had in his. Let me see&mdash; two thousand pounds&mdash;if
      the wench would promise to die when the money were spent, egad, one would
      marry her; but the fortune may go off in a year or two, and the wife may
      live&mdash;Lord knows how long. Then an innkeeper's daughter! ay, that's
      the devil&mdash;there my pride brings me off. <span class="linenum">[268]</span>

      <i><b>The Gallery in Lady Bountiful's House. Enter Mrs. Sullen and Dorinda</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Su</b></i>., Ha! ha! ha! my dear sister, let me embrace thee!
      now we are friends indeed; for I shall have a secret of yours as a pledge
      for mine&mdash;now you'll be good for something, I shall have you
      conversable in the subjects of the sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. But do you think that I am so weak as to fall in love
      with a fellow at first sight?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. Psha! now you spoil all; why should not we be as
      free in our friendships as the men? I warrant you, the gentleman has got
      to his confidant already, has avowed his passion, toasted your health,
      called you ten thousand angels, has run over your lips, eyes, neck, shape,
      air, and everything, in a description that warms their mirth to a second
      enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. Your hand, sister, I an't well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. The man's well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. Well enough! is he not a demigod, a Narcissus, a
      star, the man i' the moon? <span class="linenum">[21]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. O sister, I'm extremely ill!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. Shall I send to your mother, child, for a little
      of her cephalic plaster to put to the soles of your feet, or shall I send
      to the gentleman for something for you? Come, unlace your stays, unbosom
      yourself. The man is perfectly a pretty fellow; I saw him when he first
      came into church.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. I saw him too, sister, and with an air that shone,
      methought, like rays about his person. <span class="linenum">[30]</span>

    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. Well said, up with it!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. No forward coquette behaviour, no airs to set him off,
      no studied looks nor artful posture&mdash;but Nature did it all&mdash;

    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. Better and better!&mdash;one touch more&mdash;come!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. But then his looks&mdash;did you observe his eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. Yes, yes, I did.&mdash;His eyes, well, what of his
      eyes? <span class="linenum">[38]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. Sprightly, but not wandering; they seemed to view, but
      never gazed on anything but me.&mdash;And then his looks so humble were,
      and yet so noble, that they aimed to tell me that he could with pride die
      at my feet, though he scorned slavery anywhere else.

    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. In the first place I inquired who the gentleman was;
      they told me he was a stranger. Secondly, I asked what the gentleman was;
      they answered and said, that they never saw him before. Thirdly, I
      inquired what countryman he was; they replied, 'twas more than they knew.
      Fourthly, I demanded whence he came; their answer was, they could not
      tell. And, fifthly, I asked whither he went; and they replied, they knew
      nothing of the matter,&mdash;and this is all I could learn. <span

      mountebank, some say one thing, some another: but, for my own part, I
      believe he's a Jesuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. A Jesuit! why a Jesuit?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Because he keeps his horses always ready saddled, and
      his footman talks French.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. His footman! <span class="linenum">[70]</span>

      Ay, he and the count's footman were jabbering French like two intriguing
      ducks in a mill-pond; and I believe they talked of me, for they laughed
      consumedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. What sort of livery has the footman?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Livery! Lord, madam, I took him for a captain, he's
      so bedizzened with lace! And then he has tops to his shoes, up to his mid
      leg, a silver-headed cane dangling at his knuckles; he carries his hands
      in his pockets just so&mdash;[<i><b>walks in the French air</b></i>.&mdash;and
      has a fine long periwig tied up in a bag. &mdash;Lord, madam, he's clear
      another sort of man than I! <span class="linenum">[83]</span>

      and some cunning, the first hides the latter by abundance.&mdash;Scrub!

    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Madam!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. We have a great mind to know who this gentleman is,
      only for our satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Yes, madam, it would be a satisfaction, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. You must go and get acquainted with his footman, and
      invite him hither to drink a bottle of your ale because you 're butler
      to-day. <span class="linenum">[95]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Yes, madam, I am butler every Sunday.

      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. O' brave! sister, o' my conscience, you understand

      you know, will be gone to church, my spouse will be got to the ale-house
      with his scoundrels, and the house will be our own&mdash;so we drop in by
      accident, and ask the fellow some questions ourselves. In the country, you
      know, any stranger is company, and we're glad to take up with the butler

      <i><b>A Room in Bonifaces Inn</b></i>. <i><b>Enter Aimwell and Archer</b></i>.

    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Well, Tom, I find you 're a marksman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. A marksman! who so blind could be, as not discern a
      swan among the ravens?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Well, but hark'ee, Aimwell!

      Aimwell! call me Oroondates, Cesario, Amadis, all that romance can in a
      lover paint, and then I 'll answer. O Archer! I read her thousands in her
      looks, she looked like Ceres in her harvest: corn, wine and oil, milk and
      honey, gardens, groves, and purling streams played on her plenteous face.
      <span class="linenum">[10]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Her face! her pocket, you mean; the corn, wine and
      oil, lies there. In short, she has ten thousand pounds, that's the English
      on't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Her eyes&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Are demi-cannons, to be sure; so I won't stand their
      battery. [<i><b>Going</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>.-Pray excuse me, my passion must have vent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Passion! what a plague, d' ye think these romantic
      airs will do our business? Were my temper as extravagant as yours, my
      adventures have something more romantic by half. <span class="linenum">[21]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Your adventures!

    <p>
      There's a touch of sublime Milton for you, and the subject but an
      innkeeper's daughter! I can play with a girl as an angler does with his
      fish; he keeps it at the end of his line, runs it up the stream, and down
      the stream, till at last he brings it to hand, tickles the trout, and so
      whips it into his basket.

      would go home with him and see his cellar.
    </p>

      Orpheus play, and fair Toftida sing!

    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Psha! damn your raptures; I tell you, here's a pump
      going to be put into the vessel, and the ship will get into harbour, my
      life on't. You say, there's another lady very handsome there?

    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Yes, faith.

      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Can't you give me a bill upon Cherry in the meantime?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. No, no, friend, all her corn, wine and oil, is
      ingrossed to my market. And once more I warn you, to keep your anchorage
      clear of mine; for if you fall foul of me, by this light you shall go to

    <p>
      <i><b>Gib</b></i>. A marching regiment, sir, an old corps.

    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. [<i><b>Aside</b></i>.] Very old, if your coat be
      regimental&mdash; [<i><b>Aloud</b></i>.] You have served abroad, sir?

      honour, you know&mdash;Besides, 'twas for the good of my country that I
      should be abroad:&mdash;anything for the good of one's country&mdash; I'm

      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. What! all?

      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. You're merry, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Gib</b></i>. Ay, sir, you must excuse me, sir; I understand the
      world, especially the art of travelling: I don't care, sir, for answering
      questions directly upon the road&mdash; for I generally ride with a charge
      about me. <span class="linenum">[121]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Three or four, I believe. [Aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Gib</b></i>. I am credibly informed that there are highwaymen upon
      this quarter; not, sir, that I could suspect a gentleman of your figure&mdash;but
      truly, sir, I have got such a way of evasion upon the road, that I don't
      care for speaking truth to any man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. [<i><b>Aside</b></i>.] Your caution may be necessary.&mdash;[<i><b>Aloud</b></i>.]
      Then I presume you're no captain? <span class="linenum">[129]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Gib</b></i>. Not I, sir; captain is a good travelling name, and so I
      take it; it stops a great many foolish inquiries that are generally made
      about gentlemen that travel, it gives a man an air of something, and makes
      the <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p050.png">[50]</a></span>drawers
      obedient:&mdash;and thus far I am a captain, and no farther.

      don't think it safe to tell ye.

      Well, Mr. Boniface, what's the news? <span class="linenum">[140]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. There's another gentleman below, as the saying is, that
      hearing you were but two, would be glad to make the third man, if you
      would give him leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. What is he?

    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. A clergyman, as the saying is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. A clergyman! is he really a clergyman? or is it only
      his travelling name, as my friend the captain has it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. O sir, he's a priest, and chaplain to the French
      officers in town. <span class="linenum">[150]</span>

    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Is he a Frenchman?

    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. Yes, sir, born at Brussels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Gib</b></i>. A Frenchman, and a priest! I won't be seen in his
      company, sir; I have a value for my reputation, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Nay, but, captain, since we are by ourselves&mdash;can
      he speak English, landlord?

    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. Very well, sir; you may know him, as the saying is, to
      be a foreigner by his accent, and that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Then he has been in England before?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p051.png">[51]</a></span><i><b>Bon</b></i>.
      Never, sir; but he's a master of languages, as the saying is; he talks
      Latin&mdash;it does me good to hear him talk Latin. <span class="linenum">[162]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Then you understand Latin, Mr Boniface?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Bon</b></i>. Not I, sir, as the saying is; but he talks it so very
      fast, that I 'm sure it must be good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Pray, desire him to walk up.

      <i><b>Enter Archer and Scrub singing, and hugging one another, the latter
      with a tankard in his hand Gipsy listening at a distance</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. <i><b>Tall, all, dall!</b></i>&mdash;Come, my dear
      boy, let 's have that song once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. No, no, we shall disturb the family.&mdash;But will
      you be sure to keep the secret?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Pho! upon my honour, as I'm a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. 'Tis enough. You must know, then, that my master is
      the Lord Viscount Aimwell; he fought a duel t' other day in London,
      wounded his man so dangerously, <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p053.png">[53]</a></span>that he thinks fit to withdraw
      till he hears whether the gentleman's wounds be mortal or not He never was
      in this part of England before, so he chose to retire to this place,
      that's all. <span class="linenum">[12]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Gip</b></i>. And that's enough for me. [<i><b>Exit</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. And where were you when your master fought?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. We never know of our masters' quarrels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. No! if our masters in the country here receive a
      challenge, the first thing they do is to tell their wives; the wife tells
      the servants, the servants alarm the tenants, and in half an hour you
      shall have the whole county in arms. <span class="linenum">[21]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. To hinder two men from doing what they have no mind
      for.&mdash;But if you should chance to talk now of my business?
    </p>
    <p>
      Scrub. Talk! ay, sir, had I not learned the knack of holding my tongue, I
      had never lived so long in a great family.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Ay, ay, to be sure there are secrets in all families.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Secrets! ay;&mdash;but I 'll say no more. Come, sit
      down, we 'll make an end of our tankard: here&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i><b>Gives Archer the tankard</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. With all my heart; who knows but you and I may come to
      be better acquainted, eh? Here's your ladies' healths; you have three, I
      think, and to be sure there must be secrets among 'em. [<i><b>Drinks</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Secrets! ay, friend.&mdash;I wish I had a friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p054.png">[54]</a></span><i><b>Arch</b></i>.
      Am not I your friend? come, you and I will sworn brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Shall we?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>.. From this minute. Give me a kiss:&mdash;and no
      brother Scrub&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. And now, brother Martin, I will tell you a secret
      that will make your hair stand on end. You must know that I am consumedly
      in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. That's a terrible secret, that's the truth on't
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. That jade, Gipsy, that was with us just now in the
      cellar, is the arrantest whore that ever wore a petticoat; and I 'm dying
      for love of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;Are you in love with her person her
      virtue, brother Scrub?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. I should like virtue best, because it is more durable
      than beauty: for virtue holds good with some women long, and many a day
      after they have lost it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. In the country, I grant ye, where no woman's virtue is
      lost, till a bastard be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Ay, could I bring her to a bastard, I should have her
      all to myself; but I dare not put it upon, the lay, for fear of being sent
      for a soldier. Pray brother, how do you gentlemen in London like this same
      Pressing Act?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Very ill, brother Scrub; 'tis the worst that ever was
      made for us. Formerly I remember the good days, when we could dun our
      masters for our wage <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p055.png">[55]</a></span>and
      if they refused to pay us, we could have a warrant to carry 'em before a
      Justice: but now if we talk of eating, they have a warrant for us, and
      carry us before three Justices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. And to be sure we go, if we talk of eating; for the
      Justices won't give their own servants a bad example. Now this is my
      misfortune&mdash;I dare not speak in the house, while that jade Gipsy
      dings about like a fury.&mdash;-Once I had the better end of the staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. And how comes the change now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Why, the mother of all this mischief is a priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. A priest!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Ay, a damned son of a whore of Babylon, that came
      over hither to say grace to the French officers, and eat up our
      provisions. There's not a day goes over his head without a dinner or
      supper in this house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. How came he so familiar in the family? <span
      class="linenum">[81]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Because he speaks English as if he had lived here all
      his life, and tells lies as if he had been a traveller from his cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. And this priest, I'm afraid, has converted the
      affections of your Gipsy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Converted! ay, and perverted, my dear friend: for, I
      'm afraid, he has made her a whore and a papist! But this is not all;
      there's the French count and Mrs. Sullen, they 're in the confederacy, and
      for some private ends of their own, to be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p056.png">[56]</a></span><i><b>Arch</b></i>.
      A very hopeful family yours, brother Scrub! suppose the maiden lady has
      her lover too?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Not that I know: she's the best on 'em, that's the
      truth on't: but they take care to prevent my curiosity, by giving me so
      much business, that I'm a perfect slave. What d' ye think is my place in
      this family?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Butler, I suppose. <span class="linenum">[99]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Ah, Lord help you! I 'll tell you. Of a Monday I
      drive the coach, of a Tuesday I drive the plough, on Wednesday I follow
      the hounds, a Thursday I dun the tenants, on Friday I go to market, on
      Saturday I draw warrants, and a Sunday I draw beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Ha! ha! ha! if variety be a pleasure in life, you have
      enough on't, my dear brother. But what ladies are those?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Ours, ours; that upon the right hand is Mrs. Sullen,
      and the other is Mrs. Dorinda. Don't mind 'em; sit still, man. <span
      class="linenum">[110]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Enter Mrs. Sullen and Dorinda</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. I have heard my brother talk of my Lord Aimwell;
      but they say that his brother is the finer gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. That's impossible, sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. He's vastly rich, but very close, they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. No matter for that; if I can creep into his heart, I
      'll open his breast, I warrant him: I have heard <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p057.png">[57]</a></span>say, that people may be guessed at
      by the behaviour of their servants; I could wish we might talk to that
      fellow. <span class="linenum">[120]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. So do I; for I think he 's a very pretty fellow.
      Come this way, I'll throw out a lure for him presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i><b>Dorinda and Mrs. Sullen walk a turn towards the opposite side of
      the stage</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. [<i><b>Aside</b></i>.] Corn, wine, and oil indeed!&mdash;But,
      I think, the wife has the greatest plenty of flesh and blood; she should
      be my choice.&mdash;Ay, ay, say you so!&mdash;[<i><b>Mrs. Sullen drops her
      glove. Archer runs, takes it up and gives to her</b></i>.] Madam&mdash;your
      ladyship's glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. O sir, I thank you!&mdash;[To Dorinda.] What a
      handsome bow the fellow has! <span class="linenum">[131]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. Bow! why, I have known several footmen come down from
      London set up here for dancing-masters, and carry off the best fortunes in
      the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. [<i><b>Aside</b></i>.] That project, for aught I know,
      had been better than ours.&mdash;[<i><b>To Scrub</b></i>.] Brother Scrub,
      why don't you introduce me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Ladies, this is the strange gentleman's servant that
      you saw at church to-day; I understood he came from London, and so I
      invited him to the cellar, that he might show me the newest flourish in
      whetting my knives. <span class="linenum">[142]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. And I hope you have made much of him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p058.png">[58]</a></span><i><b>Arch</b></i>.
      Oh yes, madam, but the strength of your lady ship's liquor is a little too
      potent for the constitution of your humble servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. What, then you don't usually drink ale?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. No, madam; my constant drink is tea, or a little wine
      and water. 'Tis prescribed me by the physician for a remedy against the
      spleen. <span class="linenum">[150]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Oh la! Oh la! a footman have the spleen!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. I thought that distemper had been only proper to
      people of quality?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Madam, like all other fashions it wears Out, and so
      descends to their servants; though in a great many of us, I believe, it
      proceeds from some melancholy particles in the blood, occasioned by the
      stagnation of wages.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. [<i><b>Aside to Mrs. Sullen</b></i>.] How affectedly
      the fello* talks!&mdash;[<i><b>To Archer</b></i>.] How long, pray, have
      yon served your present master? <span class="linenum">[161]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Not long; my life has been mostly spent in the service
      of the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. And pray, which service do you like best?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Madam, the ladies pay best; the honour of serving them
      is sufficient wages; there is a charm in their looks that delivers a
      pleasure with their commands, and gives our duty the wings of inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. [<i><b>Aside</b></i>.] That flight was above the
      pitch of a livery.&mdash;[<i><b>Aloud</b></i>.] And, sir, would not you be
      satisfied to serve a lady again? <span class="linenum">[171]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p059.png">[59]</a></span><i><b>Arch</b></i>.
      As a groom of the chamber, madam, but not as a footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. I suppose you served as footman before? <i><b>Arch</b></i>.
      For that reason I would not serve in that post again; for my memory is too
      weak for the load of messages that the ladies lay upon their servants in
      London. My Lady Howd'ye, the last mistress I served, called me up one
      morning, and told me, 'Martin, go to my Lady Allnight with my humble
      service; tell her I was to wait on her ladyship yesterday, and left word
      with Mrs. Rebecca, that the preliminaries of the affair she knows of, are
      stopped till we know the concurrence of the person that I know of, for
      which there are circumstances wanting which we shall accommodate at the
      old place; but that in the meantime there is a person about her ladyship,
      that from several hints and surmises, was accessory at a certain time to
      the disappointments that naturally attend things, that to her knowledge
      are of more importance&mdash;' <span class="linenum">[191]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>., <i><b>Dor</b></i>. Ha! ha! ha! where are you
      going, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Why, I han't half done!&mdash;The whole howd'ye was
      about half an hour long; so I happened to misplace two syllables, and was
      turned off, and rendered incapable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. [<i><b>Aside to Mrs. Sullen</b></i>.] The pleasantest
      fellow, sister, I ever saw!&mdash;[<i><b>To Archer</b></i>.] But, friend,
      if your master be married, I presume you still serve a lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p060.png">[60]</a></span><i><b>Arch</b></i>.
      No, madam, I take care never to come into a married family; the commands
      of the master and mistress are always so contrary, that 'tis impossible to
      please both. <span class="linenum">[203]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. There's a main point gained: my lord is not married, I
      find. [<i><b>Aside</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. But I wonder, friend, that in so many good
      services, you had not a better provision made for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. I don't know how, madam. I had a lieutenancy offered
      me three or four times; but that is not bread, madam&mdash;I live much
      better as I do. <span class="linenum">[211]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Madam, he sings rarely! I was thought to do pretty
      well here in the country till he came; but alack a day, I 'm nothing to my
      brother Martin!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. Does he?&mdash;Pray, sir, will you oblige us with a
      song?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Are you for passion or humour?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Scrub</b></i>. Oh le! he has the purest ballad about a trifle&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. A trifle! pray, sir, let's have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. I 'm ashamed to offer you a trifle, madam; but since
      you command me&mdash; <span class="linenum">[221]</span>

     A trifling song you shall hear,
     Begun with a trifle and ended:
     All trifling people draw near,
     And I shall be nobly attended.

<span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p061.png">[61]</a></span>     Were it not for trifles, a few,
     That lately have come into play;
     The men would want something to do,
     And the women want something to say.

     What makes men trifle in dressing?                <span class="linenum">[235]</span>
     Because the ladies (they know)
     Admire, by often possessing,
     That eminent trifle, a beau.

     When the lover his moments has trifled,
     The trifle of trifles to gain:
     No sooner the virgin is rifled,
     But a trifle shall part 'em again.

     What mortal man would be able
     At White's half an hour to sit?
     Or who could bear a tea-table,                    <span class="linenum">[240]</span>
     Without talking of trifles for wit?

     The court is from trifles secure,
     Gold keys are no trifles, we see:
     White rods are no trifles, I 'm sure,
     Whatever their bearers may be.

     But if you will go to the place,
     Where trifles abundantly breed,
     The levee will show you His Grace
     Makes promises trifles indeed.

     A coach with six footmen behind,                  <span class="linenum">[250]</span>
     I count neither trifle nor sin:
     But, ye gods! how oft do we find
     A scandalous trifle within.

<span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p062.png">[62]</a></span>     A flask of champagne, people think it
     A trifle, or something as bad:
     But if you 'll contrive how to drink it;
     You 'll find it no trifle, egad!

     A parson's a trifle at sea,
     A widow's a trifle in sorrow:
     A peace is a trifle to-day,                       <span class="linenum">[260]</span>
     Who knows what may happen to-morrow!

     A black coat a trifle may cloke,
     Or to hide it, the red may endeavour:
     But if once the army is broke,
     We shall have more trifles than ever.

     The stage is a trifle, they say,
     The reason, pray carry along,
     Because at every new play,
     The house they with trifles so throng.

     But with people's malice to trifle,               <span class="linenum">[270]</span>
     And to set us all on a foot:
     The author of this is a trifle,

      soul nor property, there I must sit contented. But in England, a country
      whose women are its glory, must women be abused? where women rule, must

      comfortable society into a wilderness of solitude! I dare not keep the

      Well, good woman, I 'll tell you what you must do. You must lay your

      as broad as you can, then you must takeout the bone, and beat the flesh
      soundly with a rolling-pin, then take salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and
      ginger, some sweet-herbs, and season it very well, then roll it up like
      brawn, and put it into the oven for two hours.

      his foot, then he had a kind of laziness in his joints, and then his leg
      broke out, and then it swelled, and then it closed again, and then it
      broke out again, and then it festered, and then it grew better, and then

      and a woman, there's always a mystery and a riddle. This I know, that here
      has been the doctor with a temptation in one hand and an absolution in the

    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. I don't find anything unnatural in that thought: while
      the mind is conversant with flesh and blood, it must conform to the
      humours of the company.

      think the man is sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. You're in the right, Dorinda; pride is the life of
      a woman, and flattery is our daily bread; and she's a fool that won't

      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. O Dorinda! I own myself a woman, full of my sex, a
      gentle, generous soul, easy and yielding to soft desires; a spacious
      heart, where love and all his train might lodge. And must the fair
      apartment of my breast be made a stable for a brute to lie in?

      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. Meaning your husband, I suppose? <span class="linenum">[499]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. Husband! no; even husband is too soft a name for
      him.&mdash;But, come, I expect my brother here to-night or to-morrow; he
      was abroad when my father married me; perhaps he 'll find a way to make me
      easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. Will you promise not to make yourself easy in the
      meantime with my lord's friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Mrs. Sul</b></i>. You mistake me, sister. It happens with us as
      among the men, the greatest talkers are the greatest cowards? and there's
      a reason for it; those spirits evaporate in prattle, which might do more
      mischief if they took another course.&mdash; Though, to confess the truth,
      I do love that fellow; &mdash;and if I met him dressed as he should be,
      and I undressed as I should be&mdash;look 'ee, sister, I have no
      supernatural gifts&mdash;I can't swear I could resist the temptation;
      though I can safely promise to avoid it; and that's as much as the best of
      us can do.

      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Well, well, anything to deliver us from sauntering away
      our idle evenings at White's, Tom's, or Will's and be stinted to bare
      looking at our old acquaintance, the cards; because our impotent pockets
      can't afford us a guinea for the mercenary drabs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. Or be obliged to some purse-proud coxcomb for a
      scandalous bottle, where we must not pretend to our share of the

      we should our want of money by railing at the government.

      both houses steal two acts of a play, and because we han't money to see
      the other three, we come away discontented, and damn the whole five.

    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. Well, well, my lord, you have conquered; your late
      generous action will, I hope, plead for my easy yielding; though I must
      own, your lordship had a friend in the fort before.

    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. I 'm ready. But first, my lord, one word.&mdash;I have
      a frightful example of a hasty marriage in my own family; when I reflect
      upon't it shocks me. Pray, my lord, consider a little&mdash; <span
      class="linenum">[11]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Consider! do you doubt my honour or my love?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. Neither: I do believe you equally just as brave: <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p118.png">[118]</a></span>and were your
      whole sex drawn out forme to choose, I should not cast a look upon the
      multitude if you were absent. But, my lord, I'm a woman; colours,
      concealments may hide a thousand faults in me, therefore know me better
      first; I hardly dare affirm I know myself in anything except my love.

      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. I am no lord, but a poor needy man, come with a mean, a
      scandalous design to prey upon your fortune; but the beauties of your mind
      and person have so won me from myself that, like a trusty servant, I
      prefer the interest of my mistress to my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. Sure I have had the dream of some poor mariner, a
      sleepy image of a welcome port, and wake involved in storms!&mdash;Pray,
      sir, who are you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Aim</b></i>. Brother to the man whose title I usurped, but stranger
      to his honour or his fortune. <span class="linenum">[39]</span>

      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. Matchless honesty!&mdash;Once I was proud, sir, of your
      wealth and title, but now am prouder that you <span class="pagenum"><a

      of all without my partnership?

      No, I would sooner change conditions with the worst of the rogues we just
      now bound, than bear one scornful smile from the proud knight that once I

      methought she received my confession with pleasure.

    <p>
      <i><b>Arch</b></i>. 'Sdeath, who doubts it?

    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Dor</b></i>. Look'ee, sir, one generous action deserves another.
      &mdash;This gentleman's honour obliged him to hide nothing from me; my
      justice engages me to conceal nothing from him. In short, sir, you are the
      person that you thought you counterfeited; you are the true Lord Viscount
      Aimwell, and I wish your Lordship joy.&mdash;Now, priest, you may be gone;
      if my Lord is pleased now with the match, let his Lordship marry me in the
      face of the world.

    </p>
    <p>

      now, because I would not deceive this lady.

      untasted happiness, and the other in their deliverance from an experienced
      misery. Both happy in their several states we find, Those parted by

      If to our play your judgment can't be kind, Let its expiring author pity
      find: Survey his mournful case with melting eyes, Nor let the bard be
      damn'd before he dies. Forbear, you fair, on his last scene to frown, But
      his true exit with a plaudit crown; Then shall the dying poet cease to
      fear The dreadful knell, while your applause he hear. At Leuctra so the
      conquering Theban died, Claim'd his friends' praises, but their tears
      denied: Pleased in the pangs of death he greatly thought Conquest with
      loss of life but cheaply bought The difference this, the Greek was one
      would fight As brave, though not so gay, as Serjeant Kite; Ye sons of
      Will's, what's that to those who write? To Thebes alone the Grecian owed
      his bays, You may the bard above the hero raise, Since yours is greater
      than Athenian praise.
